# Pansy-Studio
Supporting LGBTQIA+ Creatives
Our community's dream is for Pansy Studio to become an established secure spot in central Pōneke for LGBTQIA+ artists. 
We inspire & support new and emerging artists who are fresh out of their studies in the creative queer community.
Pansy Studio supports multidisciplinary artists who build on ethical creative practices. 
We are an epitome of minorities coming together and building an array of art that challenges stereotypes. 
Pansy as a space is an art piece; a celebration of diversity within art and energy. 


Embracing Neurodiverse and Disabled Queer Artists:
Pansy is built of rainbow identities and connections with neurodiverse queer folk, all of which naturally comes to us as part of these communities ourselves.

At Pansy, you don’t need to mask any disabilities. We work alongside and invite people with physical and intellectual impairments. The studio is accessible with an elevator.

We also have quiet spaces within to care for sensory overload.

Pansy Studio on Dixon Street:
We consider and acknowledge the historical as well as current aspects of Dixon Street.

We acknowledge that Pansy Studio is on sacred land, Te Aro pā. We are passionate about connecting with Takatāpui artists and decolonising our minds.  

We are eager to dismantle systems that are destroying LGBTQIA+ lives and in particular affecting disabled community members.

The wharepaku across from Pansy (by the elevator) are gender neutral. 

Pansy Studio is an ethical, forward-thinking social enterprise that ensures safety, security and creativity for 
LGBTQIA+ artists.
Those who have seen Pansy Studio have expressed the beauty and dire need for safe spaces for minorities such 
as this one that has been created in central Pōneke.
Pansy Studio assists creative multidisciplinary artists to reach financial sustainability and give creative jobs, 
opportunities, and a safe space for our community, whilst also including ethical, forward, and modern project 
planning in all our processes to further support Rangatahi.
Although we accept donations, Pansy Studio chose to be a social enterprise rather than dependent on 
donations as to develop a reliable revenue stream for artists. Pansy strives for the artists they work with to 
sustainably thrive.
Pansy provides a space where we can have artists come together and do workshops, working through the studio 
space as well as having digital residencies. We intend on these products to broaden opportunities and ideas for 
all New Zealanders, not just the LGBTQIA+ community, to be able to experience high-quality arts.

ADEN MESER PHOTOGRAPHY | MESER CREATIVE LIMITED:
2023 Documentation for Pansy Studio projects will be created and copyrighted through Industry Professionals and Commercial 
Photographers at Aden Meser Photography, under the LLC Meser Creative Limited.
High resolution imagery and multidiscipline art will be documented, created and widely shared on the Pansy 
social media account and website as well as linking back to artist residencies/highlights.

Pansy Pals Digital [Pending Funding]:
Pansy Pals Digital is a digital safe space. An online creative artists community platform and forum on 
the https://www.pansystudio.nz/ website run by LGBTQIA+ creative artists and community managers 
keeping the digital space safe. Forum topics will also have paid guest highlights for creative artists to 
share their work and answer any questions as well as post digital workshops.

Pansy Pals Digital will be a moderated but complex digital space for viewers to understand queerness
that also has features from our other projects. A space people can look back on as a sort of time 
capsule of the LGBT+ community and digital artist residencies. It will be a digital space that is 
accessible for especially queer people with disabilities to access the content. 
Queer people need an online place to feel included and the fact that we’ll be platforming other queer 
creatives will be bringing in a lot of traffic.

The kaupapa of this project reflects Pansy Studio however in a digital realm; to create a safe platform 
for neurodiverse LGBTQIA+ artists and promoting digital equity.
Aden Meser Photography will be further developing photography and creative workshops including 
tutorials, giveaways and further discussions with guest artists for the digital platform.

Future missions include: setting up a gender-affirming care fund.
